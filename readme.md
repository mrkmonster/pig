# Pig

Pig is a dice game using one six-sided die.

You play against the computer.

Roll the die. If it's a 1, you lose all the points for that turn.

If it's 2 to 6, it's added towards the points for that turn.

You can choose to hold or roll again. If you hold, all your points for the turn are added to your score.

First to score 100 wins.

## Installation

This is a standalone executable. Stick it where you like.

## Usage

These are simple one-letter commands. "m" shows you a menu.

It's very simple...

## Contributing

This is my first exercise in writing C programs, so it's just basic. These are the things I'd like improved if I get the time.

At the moment, the AI is really an AS, an Artificial Stupid. An AS just makes random legal moves. I'd like to give it a bit of a brain once I've worked out a good optimum play strategy and which parameters need to be considered.

I'm not a fan of scanf, so I'd like it to be something else. Just for that niggly "Return" thing that happens.

I built this to be an exercise, so it might be packaged for every distro and OS I can touch, also with a GUI in GTK, QT and Windows. WXwidgets, perhaps. I probably won't use a Mac, so if you do, and run into problems, let me know.

It's built in the Code::Blocks IDE.

Some form of GPL. I haven't decided which flavour yet, but it will be GPL.
